# Tptbm
This program implements a multi-user throughput benchmark. By default, the transaction mix consists of 80% SELECT (read) transactions and 20% UPDATE (write) transactions. In addition to SELECTs and UPDATEs, INSERTs can also be included in the transaction mix. The ratio of SELECTs, UPDATEs and INSERTs is specified at the command line. Each transaction consists of one or more SQL operations.  The benchmark initially populates the data store, and then executes the transaction mix on it. The number of tuples inserted as part of the transaction mix cannot exceed the number of tuples with which the database is populated initially. The measurement error for the benchmark is at most 2 seconds. This will be negligible at loads with a duration in excess of 200 seconds. A suggested load for the benchmark is one that lasts at least 600 seconds.   The schema for this test is described in the program source file tptbm.java. Currently,it's can support databases for Oracle and Timesten and Postgresql and Mysql and Sqlserver and db2.
